\newglossaryentry{sentinel}
{
    name={Sentinel},
    description={A Sentinel is a heuristic witnesses. It observes heuristics and vouches for the certainty and accuracy of them by producing temporal ledgers. The most important aspect of a Sentinel is that it produces ledgers that Diviners can be certain came from the same source by adding Proof of Origin to them}
}

\newglossaryentry{bridge}
{
    name={Bridge},
    description={A Bridge is a heuristic transcriber. It securely relays heuristic ledgers from Sentinels to Diviners. The most important aspect of a Bridge is that a Diviner can be sure that the heuristic ledgers that are received from a Bridge have not been altered in any way. The second most important aspect of a Bridge is that they add an additional Proof of Origin metadata}
}

\newglossaryentry{archivist}
{
    name={Archivist},
    description={An Archivist stores heuristics as a part of the decentralized data set with the goal of having all historical ledgers stored, but without that requirement. Even if some data is lost or becomes temporarily unavailable, the system continues to function, just with reduced accuracy. Archivists also index ledgers so that they can return a string of ledger data if needed. Archivists store raw data only and get paid solely for retrieval of the data. Storage is always free}
}

\newglossaryentry{diviner}
{
    name={Diviner},
    description={A Diviner answers a given question by analyzing historical data that has been stored by the XYO Network. Heuristics stored in the XYO Network must have a high level of Proof of Origin to determine the validity and accuracy of the heuristic. A Diviner obtains and delivers an answer by judging the witness based on its Proof of Origin. Given that the XYO Network is a trustless system, Diviners must be incentivized to provide honest analyses of heuristics. Unlike Sentinels and Bridges, Diviners use Proof of Work to add answers to the blockchain}
}

\newglossaryentry{gas}
{
    name={gas},
    description={The cost of a transaction (i.e. question) in the form of XYO Tokens}
}

\newglossaryentry{proof-of-origin}
{
    name={Proof of Origin},
    description={Proof of Origin is the key to verifying that ledgers flowing into the XYO Network are valid. A unique ID for source of data is not practical since it can be forged. Private Key signing is not practical since most parts of the XYO Network are difficult or impossible to physically secure, thus the potential for a bad actor to steal a Private Key is too feasible. To solve this, XYO Network uses Transient Key Chaining. The benefit of this is that it is impossible to falsify the chain of origin for data. However, once the chain is broken, it is broken forever and cannot be continued, rendering it an island}
}

\newglossaryentry{proof-of-work}
{
    name={Proof of Work},
    description={Proof of Work is a piece of data that satisfies certain requirements, is difficult to produce (i.e. costly, time-consuming), but easy for others to verify. Producing a Proof of Work can be a random process with a low probability of generation so that rigorous trial and error is required on average before a valid Proof of Work is created}
}

\newglossaryentry{bound-witness}
{
    name={Bound Witness},
    description={Bound Witness is a concept achieved by the existence of a bidirectional heuristic. Given that an untrusted source of data for the use of digital contract resolution (an oracle) is not useful, there is a substantial increase in certainty of the data provided by the establishment of such a heuristic. The primary bidirectional heuristic is proximity since both parties can validate the occurrence and range of an interaction by cosigning the interaction. This allows for a zero-knowledge proof that the two nodes were in proximity of each other.}
}

\newglossaryentry{smart-contract}
{
    name={smart contract},
    description={A protocol coined by Nick Szabo before Bitcoin, purportedly in 1994 (which is why some believe him to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the mystical and unknown inventor of Bitcoin). The idea behind smart contracts is to codify a legal agreement in a program and to have decentralized computers execute its terms, instead of humans having to interpret and act on contracts. Smart contracts collapse money (e.g. Ether) and contracts into the same concept. Being that smart contracts are deterministic (like computer programs) and fully transparent and readable, they serve as a powerful way to replace middle-men and brokers}
}

\newglossaryentry{cryptoeconomics}
{
    name={cryptoeconomics},
    description={A formal discipline that studies protocols that govern the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services in a decentralized digital economy. Cryptoeconomics is a practical science that focuses on the design and characterization of these protocols}
}

\newglossaryentry{xyo-network}
{
    name={XYO Network},
    description={XYO Network stands for ``XY Oracle Network.'' It is comprised of the entire system of XYO enabled components/nodes that include Sentinels, Bridges, Archivists, and Diviners. The primary function of the XYO Network is to act as a portal by which digital smart contracts can be executed through real world geo-location confirmations}
}

\newglossaryentry{certainty}
{
    name={certainty},
    description={A measure of the likelihood that a data point or heuristic is free from corruption or tampering}
}

\newglossaryentry{accuracy}
{
    name={accuracy},
    description={A measure of confidence that a data point or heuristic is within a specific margin of error}
}

\newglossaryentry{oracle}
{
    name={oracle},
    description={A part of a DApp (decentralized application) system that is responsible for resolving a digital contract by providing an answer with accuracy and certainty. The term ``oracle'' originates from cryptography where it signifies a truly random source (e.g. of a random number). This provides the necessary gate from a crypto equation to the world beyond. Oracles feed smart contracts information from beyond the chain (the real world, or off-chain). Oracles are interfaces from the digital world to the real world. As a morbid example, consider a contract for a Last Will \& Testament. A Will's terms are executed upon confirmation that the testator is deceased. An oracle service could be built to trigger a Will by compiling and aggregating relevant data from official sources. The oracle could then be used as a feed or end-point for a smart contract to call out to in order to check whether or not the person is deceased}

{
    name={Best Answer Score},
    description={A score generated by a Best Answer Algorithm that ranks the quality of the score.  The higher the score, the better it is, per the algorithm.  This score is used to determine which answer is better given two analyzed answers}

\newglossaryentry{best-answer-algorithm}
{
    name={Best Answer Algorithm},
    description={An algorithm used to generate Best Answer Scores when a Diviner chooses an answer.  The XYO Network permits the addition of specialized algorithms and allows the customer to specify which algorithm to use.  It is required that this algorithm will result in the same score when run on any Diviner given the same data set}

\begin{abstract}
Loss and theft protection is a major feature that many insurance companies offer. From mobile phones to sports cars, owned assets that roam around on a regular basis are prime candidates to be covered under this type of insurance. The \Gls{xy-oracle-network} can report an insured item's location by providing independently verified and trustless location data. The ability to recover an item that has been reported as lost or stolen satisfies the insured party, and the ability to locate such an item in the case of a falsely reported claim protects the insurer from fraud.  The \Gls{xyo-network}'s decentralized blockchain technology thusly gives both the insurer and the insuree access to the same verified data and ultimately establishes unprecedented accountability for both parties.

\section {Problem}
Insurance for vehicles, modular homes, and other high-value, high-mobility objects can reimburse for theft, but can't inherently assist in locating the original good. The insurance industry is also susceptible to fraud, especially in the case of insured items that are highly mobile.


\section {Solution}
XY is already working with an insurance company that covers high value, high mobility goods to help them process claims and recover insured goods. Using the \Gls{xy-oracle-network}, a decentralized and trustless location-based blockchain ledger, the company and its customers have access to an independently verifiable location history in the event of a claim. Additionally, police investigators can access this location history in their attempt to recover stolen goods.

\section {How it Works}
Each insured good is equipped with an \Gls{xyo-network} device that serves as both a ``\Gls{sentinel}'' and a ``\Gls{bridge}.'' Sentinels record \gls{heuristic} data like location, temperature, speed, and other situationally appropriate information. They also record their connection with other nearby Sentinels along with the history of those Sentinels, building a distributed ledger or blockchain. Bridges are IoT devices that report data received from Sentinels to decentralized nodes, creating a decentralized ledger (blockchain). The interaction history between Sentinels and Bridges, combined with the heuristic data that is recorded, allows for a high degree of both \gls{accuracy} and \gls{certainty} for each individual Sentinel's record. Nodes which report and archive highly accurate and certain data will be rewarded with XYO Tokens, which provides a \gls{cryptoeconomics}-based incentive to expand and grow the \Gls{xyo-network}.

When a claim is made on an insured item that is connected to the XYO Network, the owner and the company can access its Sentinel's historical data on the blockchain. The decentralized and trustless nature of the blockchain helps prevent insurance fraud, as data archived in the blockchain cannot be altered and can be accessed by either the company or the insured party. The installed XYO Network Sentinel/Bridge will also continue actively reporting, aiding in the recovery of the insured item. Unlike systems like the Lojack, XYO Network devices record location history and can be accessed by the devices' owners, not just law enforcement.
