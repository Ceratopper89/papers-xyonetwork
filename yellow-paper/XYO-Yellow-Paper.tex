\newglossaryentry{sentinel}
{
    name={Sentinel},
    description={A Sentinel is a heuristic witnesses. It observes heuristics and vouches for the certainty and accuracy of them by producing temporal ledgers. The most important aspect of a Sentinel is that it produces ledgers that Diviners can be certain came from the same source by adding Proof of Origin to them}
}

\newglossaryentry{bridge}
{
    name={Bridge},
    description={A Bridge is a heuristic transcriber. It securely relays heuristic ledgers from Sentinels to Diviners. The most important aspect of a Bridge is that a Diviner can be sure that the heuristic ledgers that are received from a Bridge have not been altered in any way. The second most important aspect of a Bridge is that they add an additional Proof of Origin metadata}
}

\newglossaryentry{archivist}
{
    name={Archivist},
    description={An Archivist stores heuristics as a part of the decentralized data set with the goal of having all historical ledgers stored, but without that requirement. Even if some data is lost or becomes temporarily unavailable, the system continues to function, just with reduced accuracy. Archivists also index ledgers so that they can return a string of ledger data if needed. Archivists store raw data only and get paid solely for retrieval of the data. Storage is always free}
}

\newglossaryentry{diviner}
{
    name={Diviner},
    description={A Diviner answers a given query by analyzing historical data that has been stored by the XYO Network. Heuristics stored in the XYO Network must have a high level of Proof of Origin to determine the validity and accuracy of the heuristic. A Diviner obtains and delivers an answer by judging the witness based on its Proof of Origin. Given that the XYO Network is a trustless system, Diviners must be incentivized to provide honest analyses of heuristics. Unlike Sentinels and Bridges, Diviners use Proof of Work to add answers to the blockchain}
}

\newglossaryentry{webble}
{
    name={webble},
    description={Everything in the world is defined spatially by its \textit{X,Y,Z,T} coordinate and nothing can leave that space. Objects are thus confined to ``webbubbles'', or what are referred to as \textit{webbles}.}
}

\newglossaryentry{gas}
{
    name={gas},
    description={The cost of a transaction (i.e. query) in the form of XYO Tokens}
}

\newglossaryentry{proof-of-origin}
{
    name={Proof of Origin},
    description={Proof of Origin is the key to verifying that ledgers flowing into the XYO Network are valid. A unique ID for source of data is not practical since it can be forged. Private key signing is not practical since most parts of the XYO Network are difficult or impossible to physically secure, thus the potential for a bad actor to steal a private key is too feasible. To solve this, XYO Network uses Transient Key Chaining. The benefit of this is that it is impossible to falsify the chain of origin for data. However, once the chain is broken, it is broken forever and cannot be continued, rendering it an island}
}

\newglossaryentry{proof-of-work}
{
    name={Proof of Work},
    description={Proof of Work is a piece of data that satisfies certain requirements, is difficult to produce (i.e. costly, time-consuming), but easy for others to verify. Producing a Proof of Work can be a random process with a low probability of generation so that rigorous trial and error is required on average before a valid Proof of Work is created}
}

\newglossaryentry{bound-witness}
{
    name={Bound Witness},
    description={Bound Witness is a concept achieved by the existence of a bidirectional heuristic. Given that an untrusted source of data for the use of digital contract resolution (an oracle) is not useful, there is a substantial increase in certainty of the data provided by the establishment of such a heuristic. The primary bidirectional heuristic is proximity since both parties can validate the occurrence and range of an interaction by cosigning the interaction. This allows for a zero-knowledge proof that the two nodes were in proximity of each other.}
}

\newglossaryentry{smart-contract}
{
    name={smart contract},
    description={A protocol coined by Nick Szabo before Bitcoin, purportedly in 1994 (which is why some believe him to be Satoshi Nakamoto, the mystical and unknown inventor of Bitcoin). The idea behind smart contracts is to codify a legal agreement in a program and to have decentralized computers execute its terms, instead of humans having to interpret and act on contracts. Smart contracts collapse money (e.g. Ether) and contracts into the same concept. Being that smart contracts are deterministic (like computer programs) and fully transparent and readable, they serve as a powerful way to replace middle-men and brokers}
}

\newglossaryentry{cryptoeconomics}
{
    name={cryptoeconomics},
    plural={cryptoeconomic},
    description={A formal discipline that studies protocols that govern the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services in a decentralized digital economy. Cryptoeconomics is a practical science that focuses on the design and characterization of these protocols}
}

\newglossaryentry{xyo-network}
{
    name={XYO Network},
    description={XYO Network stands for ``XY Oracle Network.'' It is comprised of the entire system of XYO enabled components/nodes that include Sentinels, Bridges, Archivists, and Diviners. The primary function of the XYO Network is to act as a portal by which digital smart contracts can be executed through real world geo-location confirmations}
